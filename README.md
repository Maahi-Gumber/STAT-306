STAT 306 Final Project: Predicting Canada's Olympic Medals
In this project, we aimed to predict the number of medals Canada would win in the 2024 Summer Olympics based on historical data. We used variables like the number of Canadian athlete entries, entries from other countries, average athlete age, and female participation, sourced from the Olympic Historical Dataset on Kaggle. After conducting a regression analysis, we found a moderate relationship between these variables and Canada's medal count, but models had limitations due to small sample size and multicollinearity between variables like female participation and the start date of the Olympics. Our final models provide some predictive power but suggest the need for additional factors or variables to improve accuracy. Future work could expand the scope to other countries and explore athlete-specific metrics.
